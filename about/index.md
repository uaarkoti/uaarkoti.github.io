My name is Udaypal Aarkoti (Uday), and I work for CloudBees as the Director of Solution Architecture. I work with a variety of customers implementing Continuous Delivery from the unicorns (Google, Netflix, eBay) in this space to large financial, retail, banking, insurance, healthcare, telecom, startups and goverment organizations. Prior to joining CloudBees, I lead the Middleware Solution Architects @ Red Hat.

I absolutely love my role, as a Solution Architect, as it gives me an oppurtunity to work with a variety of organizations that are solving / implementing complex problems / solutions and in a small way contribute to help them achieve their goal.

## Current Role
In my current role I help organizations implement continuous delivery using [Jenkins](http://jenkins-ci.org), a popular open source continuous integration solution.

## Past
For nearly 7years I worked with organizations looking to adopt JBoss Middleware Technologies to build scalable, distributed, fault tolerant, cost effective solutions.

## Speaker
Occasionally I speak about the technologies I work with at various conferences, webinars etc.
