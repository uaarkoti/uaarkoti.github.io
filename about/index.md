My name is Udaypal Aarkoti (Uday), and I work for CloudBees as the Director of Solution Architecture. I live in the Silicon Valley and work with a variety of organizations looking to improve thier SDLC process from the unicorns (Google, Netflix, eBay) in this space to large financial, retail, banking, insurance, healthcare, telecom and goverment organizations. Prior to joining CloudBees, I lead the Middleware Solution Architects @ Red Hat.

I absolutely love my role, as a Solution Architect, as it gives me a very unique opportunity to peek into ways organizations (small and big) are building software and culture around it to be successful.

I enjoy reading / learning / implementing anything related to software, efficiency and automation.

## Current Role
In my current role I help organizations implement continuous delivery using [Jenkins](http://jenkins-ci.org), a popular open source continuous integration solution.

## Past
Before CloudBees I worked @ Red Hat for nearly 7 years and lead the JBoss Middleware SA team. Learnt a lot about open source and became a strong believer in Open Source. Saw the transformation happen in that period from CIO's questioning the viability of open source in ther IT to considering Open Source a critical part of their implementation and ultimately their success.

## Speaker
Occasionally I speak about the technologies I work with at various conferences, webinars and meetups.
