## Command Line Productivity

If you are a developer or systems engineer and use \*nix based OSes predominantly, you probably spend a lot of time using your command line. A lot of time is spent in repeating a set of tasks. Everyone seem to have discovered there own techniques over time and these are some of the techniques I learnt that help me significantly to help improving my productivity on a daily basis.

## My environment

I use a Mac mostly and occasionally fedora / ubuntu based OSes.
I use [zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) on my Mac and `bash` on Linux based OSes.
