## Announcing Bay Area Jenkins Area Meetup (JAM) Kickoff
There are quite a few [Jenkins](http://jenkins-ci.org) users in the Bay Area / Silicon Valley yet there are no regular meetups to interact and share the knowledge. We are proposing a Bay Area Jenkins Area Meetup so folks interested in Jenkins can listen, share and collaborate on a regular basis.

## Goal of Bay Area JAM
- Learn how others are using Jenkins?
- Learn about what's new and cool with Jenkins?
- See how new cutting edge technologies like Docker, Kubernetes etc... can be leveraged in / with Jenkins
- Learn about CI / CD / DevOps related tools, technologies, problems & solutions
- Learn about best practices

As suggested in the [Jenkins CIA program](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Jenkins+CIA+Program), this will be a community driven event and the purpose is to evangelize Jenkins.

We would like to kick off this meetup shortly and love to engage with the broader community to get their feedback.

We are looking for volunteers and sponsors. [CloudBees](https://www.cloudbees.com) has kindly agreed to host meetups in the [San Jose campus](https://www.cloudbees.com/office/san-francisco). It will be great if others (sponsors) are willing to host this meetup so we can reach out to broader audience across the Bay Area.

### What to expect next?
- A kickoff meeting for planning (anywhere in the bayarea) - suggestions welcome
  - Date, time and venue. This will most probably be a social event at a local coffee shop.
- First Meetup at [CloudBees](https://www.cloudbees.com/office/san-francisco)
  - Date to be announced after the initial planning kickoff
  - Speaker 1 : [@kohsukekawa](https://twitter.com/kohsukekawa)
  - Speaker 2: Open
- A list of next planned meetups

Please reach out to [me](mailto:uaarkoti@cloudbees.com) if you'd like to volunteer, have suggestions on topics / speakers, know of potential sponsors for this meetup.

>> Onwards, Uday
